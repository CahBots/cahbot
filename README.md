#### ***A small Discord bot with loads of potential***

Heyo, this is CahBot, a small Discord bot with- wait, I'm repeating myself here. Uhh...

#### **CahBot:** A bot that kinda sucks

Wait, no, that's bad to say

Hold on...

#### **CahBot:** A bot that kinda sucks but is being worked on every day

Better

Anyways, here's the current command list (literally just copy & pasted from the command list, but spiced up a bit.)

Command |  Description
--------------------|--------------
(upon saying "CB prefix") | Reminds you the prefix.
`^about` | Shows you some info about CB, or something
`^rnumber` [Low Num] [High Num] | Gives you a random number between a given range. Ex: `^rnumber 1 10`
`^help` | Shows a message telling you to use `^cmds`
`^cmds` | Returns a list of commands
`^flip` | flips a coin, what else did you expect?
`^reverse` | Reverses text.
`^eightball` | Shake the magic 8ball!
`^userinfo` | Show some basic info about yourself.
`^ping` | Used to show response time
`^invite` | Gives you a link to invite the bot to your own server!
`^die` | Shuts me down, only Cah can use this command!
`^roll` | Rolls a number between 1 and 6
`^eval` | Like you don't know what eval commands do (you still can't run them anyway)
`^donate` | Want to donate? That's great! This command gives you a link for Donorbox donations
`^update` | Gives you the latest CB update
`^say` | Makes CB say something, you need the manage messages permission tho
 
#### **Why is this repo here, you may ask**
 
 Well, it's a pretty easy way to transfer code from my PC to my VPS, that's the only reason. But if you want, you can use some of the code
